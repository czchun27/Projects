Final Project: Competitive Pokemon Visualizations
Research Question 1: How much more powerful have new pokÃ©mon
become over time and does this indicate power creep?

We answer this question by plotting average base stats of new
pokemon from generation to generation. This plot, saved as
avg_stats_by_gen.png, shows a general increase in stats, both
when we consider only new, original pokemon, and when we include
new forms, such as mega evolutions and regional forms. This shows
that on average, pokemon are getting more powerful from generation
to generation.
