Q: The DBMS that we use in this assignment, SQLServer, is running somewhere in one of 
Microsoft's data centers. What are some of the pros and cons of using a cloud-hosted DBMS? 
Would you recommend it to a fellow student for tinkering/experimentation? What about 
recommending it to future co-workers for their project? If your answer differed, why?

A: One of the pros of cloud-hosted DBMS is that they can run queries much faster than personal computers
(I believe this was a reason we used one in this assignment). This increased computing power is essential 
for large scale projects, such as those that many companies take on. However, it seems a bit overkill for 
small student projects. Additionally, cloud based data base management systems can be accessed from multiple 
computers, making it incredibly convenient for groups of people to work on.

The main cons of cloud-hosted DBMS are that they are hosted by companies, meaning that we must pay a 
subscription fee for the service. Additionally, we may encounter issues with out of date versions and
server outages.

Overall, cloud hosted DBMS seem overkill for students, since we don't have much of a practical need to
manage enormous amounts of data. However, for companies or groups a cloud hosted DBMS seems like a good
investment, as the convenience and efficiency seem worth any cons for larger groups of people.
