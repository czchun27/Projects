            There are more stars in our universe than grains of sand in all of Earth's deserts
            and on all of its beaches. There are more than 200 billion stars in the Milky
            Way galaxy alone, 10% of which are similar to the Sun. Nearly a fifth of those
            Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized plant in the "habitable zone", meaning there are
            an estimated 4 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy. That number balloons to
            40 billion if you include planets orbiting red dwarfs. The closest one? That would
            be Proxima Centauri b, which orbits the closest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri,
            a mere 4.2 light-years away. If you were traveling at the speed of the
            fastest-moving manmade object (the Parker Solar Probe), an amazing 68.6 km/s,
            it would still take 18,500 years to get there. So close, yet so far.

        <h2>Life in our solar system?</h2>
        <!-- Information sourced from NASA website:
          https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/moons/europa/exploration/ -->
        <p>
          Scientists belive that in order for life to thrive on another planet, it must have
          three things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Liquid Water</li>
          <li>The Necessary Chemicals For Life
            <ul>
              <li>Nitrogen</li>
              <li>Carbon</li>
              <li>Hydrogen</li>
              <li>Oxygen</li>
              <li>Sulfur</li>
              <li>Phosphorus</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>An Energy Source</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So far we have yet to find signs of life anywhere in out galaxy other than Earth.
          However, many scientists speculate that there is a chance that there is life
          in our own solar system.

        <h3>Europa</h3>
        <section>
          <!-- Information sourced from NASA website:
            https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/moons/europa/exploration/ -->
          <p>
            Europa, a moon of Jupiter, is an icy moon 1/4 the diameter of Earth (3100 km).
            It is suspected that Europa hosts a salt water ocean ~15 miles below it's icy surface.
            Since water is perhaps the most important requirement for life, the existence
            of Europa's ocean has given scientists hope that life has a chance to develop
            outside of Earth. <strong>There is currently a mission set to launch in October 2024
            to send a satellite to observe Europa by 2030.</strong>

        <h3>Enceladus</h3>
        <section>
          <!-- Information sourced from NASA website:
            https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/enceladus/ -->
          <p>
            Another promising option is Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. Like Europa,
            Enceladus is an icy moon with a salt water ocean beneath it's surface.
            Additionally, the moon is known to shoot out jets of its ocean water into space,
            where scientists were able to sample it and not only identify that the ocean
            contains the chemicals necessary for life, but also that the moon's ocean has active
            hydrothermal vents heating it's ocean.
            However, Enceladus is significantly smaller than Europa, with a diameter of 504 km.
            <strong>One proposed NASA mission would have a lander sent to Enceladus in
            2030 and land in 2050</strong>
