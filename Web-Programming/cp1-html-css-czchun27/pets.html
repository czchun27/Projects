          <h2>Cookie</h2>
          <p>
            This is Cookie. She is approximately 12 years old. She is a pastel calico and
            she is very friendly towards humans (not so much towards other cats).

            She was adopted by my girlfriend's dad after he found her pregnant on the street.
            After giving birth to many kittens, including Olaf, she spent most of her life
            at his shop as a working cat, catching mice and scaring away racoons. However,
            she recently became a house cat due to her age and currently lives happily
            with my girlfriend's family.

        <article>
          <h2>Olaf</h2>
          <p>
            This is Olaf. He is approximately 7 years old. He has white/blonde fur and has
            no tail. He is very friendly to humans and has a distinctively loud purr
            (almost like an engine). He also sheds a lot of fur.

            When his mom, Cookie, gave birth to her litters, my girlfriend's family gave
            away as many of the kittens as they could but chose to keep Olaf. He is
            extremely chonky but he isn't insecure about his weight at all!

        <article>
          <h2>Aki</h2>
          <p>
            This is Aki. She is approximately 3 1/2 years old. She is a tortoise shell cat who
            is very friendly towards both humans and other cats. She was adopted by my girlfriend's
            family after my girlfriend found her on the street as a kitten. She was the first cat my
            girlfriend adopted while we were together and was largely the reason I grew
            to love cats so much.

        <article>
          <h2>Cooper</h2>
          <p>
            This is Cooper. He has orange/golden and white fur and no tail. He was adopted by my
            girlfriend from a shelter as a kitten to play with Aki. He was an extremely loving
            cat to both humans and other animals, and was my favorite cat. Unfortunately,
            he passed away last Christmas due to a chronic heart condition that he was born with.

        <article>
          <h2>Ivy</h2>
          <p>
            This is Ivy. She is approximately 2 1/2 years old. Like Aki, she is a tortoise
            shell cat. She is friendly towards people but is somewhat territorial towards other
            cats in the house. She was adopted by my girlfriend's family after my girlfriend found
            her in a bush as a kitten. She got along very well with Aki and Cooper who were a
            year older than her.

        <article>
          <h2>Hazel</h2>
          <p>
            This is Hazel. She is approximately 1 1/2 years old. She is a mix mainly of german
            shepherd, husky, and pitbull. She was bought as a gift to my girlfriend's little
            sister. As a dog raised in a household full of cats she is always causing mischief.
            She is a calm dog who rarely barks and she is a great taste-tester in the kitchen.

        <article>
          <h2>Jiji</h2>
          <p>
            This is Jiji. He is approximately 4 years old. He is a black cat with long hair.
            He was adopted by my parents from the shelter as an adult cat along with Spooky.
            He is considered a garden cat since the shelter was unable to catch him before
            he matured (meaning he isn't used to people and is meant to live in our backyard).
            We adopted him because I wanted a cat and we had a mice problem under our house,
            and so far things have worked out well. Although, Jiji has slowly become more and
            more like a house cat, lounging around inside instead of working.

        <article>
          <h2>Spooky</h2>
          <p>
            This is Spooky. He is approximately 4 years old. He is a black cat with short hair.
            He was adopted by my parents from the shelter as an adult cat along with Jiji.
            He is considered a garden cat since the shelter was unable to catch him before he
            matured (meaning he isn't used to people and is meant to live in our backyard).
            We adopted him because I wanted a cat and we had a mice problem under our house,
            and so far things have worked out well. Spooky is the more productive of the two cats,
            and has caught 6 rodents since arriving at our home.

          <h2>Eddie</h2>
          <p>
            This is Eddie. He is approximately 9 months old. He is a white and grey tabby who
            is very friendly towards humans and other animals. He is Crash's brother.

            He was taken in by my girlfriend's family
            along with Crash after my girlfriend and I found them sitting next to a burnt down
            houseas kittens.
            We were unable to find the mother or other kittens, so we decided to take care of and
            foster them.
            While we raised them, Hazel took interest in them and acted as a mother to them and
            would play and cuddle with them.
            We were ultimately unable to find a new home for them, so we decided to adopt them.
